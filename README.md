# Web Guesser

This is a number guessing game to practice using Sinatra to create my first web application. It was built following a Jumpstart Labs [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html).

It's the first project in the Rails section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-basics).

## Goals

The application will:
  * Generate a random number on startup
  * Have a web page where you can enter a guess
  * Tell you whether your guess wasâ€¦
    * Way too high
    * Too high
    * Correct
    * Too low
    * Way too low
  * Change CSS based on your guess
  * Run a cheat mode when you manually edit the URL

## Thoughts

  * The application was straightforward and I finished it in a morning, but it did reveal massive holes in my knowledge about the basic structure of the web. My next step is to go back and learn the basics of HTTP requests and responses, how URLs are structured, what a web server actually does, etc, before creating my own web app with Sinatra.
